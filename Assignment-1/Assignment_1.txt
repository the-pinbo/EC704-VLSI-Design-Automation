Given: An array of rectangles in the file test_data.txt. The following is the format of the representation of rectangle:
{rectangle_id, left_bottom_corner_x_coordinate, left_bottom_corner_y_coordinate, right_top_corner_x_coordinate, right_top_corner_y_coordinate}. 

Develop python codes in modular fashion to perform the following functions:
Read data corresponding to the rectangular objects from the file test_data.txt. Using matplotlib or any other suitable library plot the given objects in Jupyter IDE.

Read the test data from a file "test_data.txt". Display the rectangle/s graphically in the Jupyter IDE. 

Problems to be solved using Python:
Q1) Accept input {x, y} from the keyboard. Print if this point lies within any of the rectangles in the given test data set. If yes then list the rectangles enclosing the given point in the format {rectangle_id, rectangle_id, rectangle_id, ... rectangle_id}. Eg: {1, 5, 8} implies that given point(x, y) is enclosed in the rectangles 1, 5 and 8.

Q2) List of rectangles that don't overlap any other rectangles. The output should be in the format {rectangle_id, rectangle_id, rectangle_id, ... rectangle_id} 

Q3) List of rectangles that overlap with other rectangles in the format {{rectangle_id, list_of_rectangle_ids_which_are_overlapping_with_it}, {rectangle_id, list_of_rectangle_ids_which_are_overlapping_with_it}, ..... {rectangle_id, list_of_rectangle_ids_which_are_overlapping_with_it}}
Eg: {{5, 7, 9, 12}, {6, 10, 12}} implies that rectangle 5 overlaps with rectangles 7, 9 and 12; rectangle 6 overlaps with rectangles 10 and 12.

Q4) List of rectangles that contain other rectangles in the format {rectangle_id, list_of_rectangle_ids_which_are_contained_in}
Eg: {{5, 2, 6}, {4, 3, 9}} implies that rectangle 5 contains rectangles 2 and 6; rectangle 4 contains rectangles 3 and 9.

Q5) List the rectangles that are abutting each other in the following format {rectangle_id, which side_(e, w, n, s), rectangle_id_of_abutting_rectangle_id}
Eg: {{5, n, 7}, {4, e, 3}} implies that rectangle 5 has rectangle 7 abutting it on the northern side, rectangle 4 has rectangle 3 abutting it on the eastern side.
